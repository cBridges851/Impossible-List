# Impossible-List
This is the list of goals I would like to achieve in my life. It is kind of like a bucket list, but it evolves and encourages you to take action now. Therefore, I aim to look at and update this regularly, so look out for any updates! This was inspired by Thomas Frank's YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apcEae2U4w&t=3s) and his example on his website (https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) - I recommend checking out both.  
  
Since this is a personal project with my own goals, I'm not looking for contributors on this project, but I do recommend that you make your own! The link to my Impossible List is here: https://cbridges851.github.io/Impossible-List/.
