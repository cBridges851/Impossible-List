            If you've stumbled across this little web page, then hi! I'm Christa, and I'm an 
            apprentice application developer. I was doing some research on goal setting and I came 
            across Thomas Frank's video about his Impossible List 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apcEae2U4w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apcEae2U4w</a>),
            and I really liked this, so much so I decided to write my own (and it gave me an opportunity 
            to practise web design, win win)! This is kind of like a bucket list, but it continuously grows
            and encourages you to take action now. I hope you enjoy looking through my list, and I encourage 
            you to create your own too!
